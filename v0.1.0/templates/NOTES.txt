--------Please be patient while the chart is being deployed--------

*Tip*
Watch the deployment status using the command: kubectl get pods -w --namespace {{ .Release.Namespace }} -l release={{ .Release.Name }}

Monitor the Cloudcasa UI, the regsitered cluster state should be ready. If the clutser state is in Pending, wrong ClusterID would have been provided.
